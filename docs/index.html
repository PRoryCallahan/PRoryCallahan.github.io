        <p>I am director of the Newman Institute for Catholic Thought & Culture and Assistant Professor of English and Humanities at St. Gregory the Great Seminary with offices in Lincoln, NE. Since 2010 I have been working on the scholia (ancient commentaries) to the Greek lyric poet Pindar (c.518-c.438 BC). That project has had many iterations, false starts, and break throughs. Along the way I realized when working with a corpus this big and aiming for maximum accessibility that, while I am still working to produce an updated version of A.B. Drachmann's 3-volume edition of the Pindar Scholia (1903-1927), the end goal is a Pindaric multitext (with both digital UI & print options) composed of various manuscripts, editions, metrical notations, translations, scholia, commentary, and scholarship inspired by the greatest of lyric poets.</p>
