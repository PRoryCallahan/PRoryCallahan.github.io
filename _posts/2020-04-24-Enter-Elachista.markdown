It's a strange thing in the Classics to have a dissertation that was never aiming for usual Nachleben. It's test was not whether or not it could become a popular monograph, but to produce some final online product: the Pindar multitext and the Pindar Opera Viewer (POV) to view the same.

Perhaps I have made the classic blunder of mistaking a hypothesis for a thesis. As I work more on stripping down the Scaife viewer to fit the other site I created for the texts, I realize that I am making more work for myself than is necessary. Moreover, I am bending a Jekyll template and a viewer not designed for my specific task to what I desire. I'm hacking in the bad sense in that I started out with what was there, a square block, and am chopping away and pasting till I get it to fit the round hole of my purpose.

On a personal level, I wanted to start a new personal portfolio and blog to step back and reevaluate my use of other social media. At home with five kids, there are lots of times where I can't do my normal work but I can code (such as when I supervise a certain 3 year old with sleep problem's nap and bedtime). Yesterday I had run this new, local Jekyll site with Minima, i.e. the basic Jekyll starter template. Today, I started to tinker with ideas for how I could adapt the Minima theme to the needs of presenting texts in multiple languages with language learning tools. And so began my notes for how to transform Minima in Elachista (sup. of ἐλαχύς, the archaic alternative to μικρότατα, the Greek for Minima). Eventually, if Elachista seems to hold up, I'll look to produce a second, more user-friendly variation, Mikrotata, for use by my fellow Digital Humanist friends to adopt as suits their purpose.

So what are the needs I identified so far?

1. Move blog over to separate folder and page.

2. This way I can make a proper landing page.

3. Page for a viewer and instructions for linking to text repo.

4. Rethink style sheets with an emphasis on responsive design. This is among my chief concerns with our existing infrastructure. We have really powerful and amazing desktop web viewers and some innovative work on building apps to display some of those works. But I think we all see the problem with developing separate web apps: constant need to update and develop for multiple OSes.
