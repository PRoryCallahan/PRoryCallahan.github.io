I recently came across a comment that Aristotle was a "working-class" man, and since we know no Classicist can avoid a "well, actually" moment, and, more importantly, the answer is intriguing, I wanted to set out here to answer the question: Just how rich was Aristotle?

![School of Athens](img/posts/2020-11-25-Aristotle/Sanzio_01_Plato_Aristotle.jpg)

There are a lot of false modern analogies that might logically lead someone to the conclusion that Aristotle was a working-class man. His father, Nicomachus, was a practicing physician. While that is certainly no stone-cutter like Socrates, we might imagine his father as a middle-class physician. And Aristotle himself got his hands dirty tutoring a group of teenagers in his 40s.

But the job is less important than the connection when it comes to both Aristotle and his father. Nicomachus was no G making house calls on a quaint Greek island, but court physician to Philip II of Macedon. And as Diogenes Laertius says (5.1.1), Nicomachus held the rank of φίλος or "friend" to Amyntas, the king of Macedon. To those familiar with Macedonian governing structures, "friend" was high rank in court. And so we find references in papyri to Ptolemy's "friends" measuring land, levying taxes, etc.

Aristotle, while orphaned as a teen, had family estates in both Stagira (father's family) and Euboea (mother's family). He certainly had the wherewithal to remain in Athens hanging about the Academy for over two decades. (To invite another false analogy: Was Aristotle a rich brat who could afford perpetual grad school?). And what about our assumption that his job of tutoring middle school boys? Does it not say something more about our own sad hierarchy of importance attached to the age we find ourselves teaching? Moreover, those boys were Alexander, heir to the Macedonian throne, and a cohort of Macedonian nobility who would become kings themselves after Alexander's early demise.

Attempts to put wealth in today's dollars are often idle, and always ephemeral--try calculating Crassus' wealth in 2020 dollars based on 1920s British calculations from popular histories.

Still, cataloging what is listed in his will, recorded in Diogenes Laertius, should certainly impress upon us the fact that Aristotle was no Plumber Joe:

To Herpyllis (his concubine after the death of his wife Pythias):
1. a talent of silver
2. 3 female slaves
3. continued use of another female slave
4. the male slave, Pyrrhaeus
5. the choice of a villa in Chalcis or Stagira
6. money to furnish either house

To his slave, Myrmex:
1. Return to his family with property

To Ambracis:
1. Manumission
2. Upon the marriage of Aristotle's daughter: 500 drachmae and a female slave

To Thale:
1. Continued use of a female slave
2. 1000 drachmae
3. an additional female slave

To Simon:
1. Enough money to purchase an additional slaves

To Tycho, Philo, Olympius, and child:
1. Manumussion upon his daughter's marriage

Other provisions:
1. Execution of several portraits of family/friends
2. Erection of a bust of Arimnestus
3. Dedication of his mother's statue at Nemea, vel. sim.
4. Burial of his wife, Pythias, beside him
5. Erection of life-sized statues to Zeus and Athena in Stagira.

[Diogenes Laertius 5.11-16](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D1):

> Such then was the life of the philosopher. I have also come across his will, which is worded thus:

> "All will be well; but, in case anything should happen, Aristotle has made these dispositions. Antipater is to be executor in all matters and in general; [12] but, until Nicanor shall arrive, Aristomenes, Timarchus, Hipparchus, Dioteles and (if he consent and if circumstances permit him) Theophrastus shall take charge as well of Herpyllis and the children as of the property. And when the girl shall be grown up she shall be given in marriage to Nicanor; but if anything happen to the girl (which heaven forbid and no such thing will happen) before her marriage, or when she is married but before there are children, Nicanor shall have full powers, both with regard to the child and with regard to everything else, to administer in a manner worthy both of himself and of us. Nicanor shall take charge of the girl and of the boy Nicomachus as he shall think fit in all that concerns them as if he were father and brother. And if anything should happen to Nicanor (which heaven forbid!) either before he marries the girl, or when he has married her but before there are children, any arrangements that he may make shall be valid. [13] And if Theophrastus is willing to live with her, he shall have the same rights as Nicanor. Otherwise the executors in consultation with Antipater shall administer as regards the daughter and the boy as seems to them to be best. The executors and Nicanor, in memory of me and of the steady affection which Herpyllis has borne towards me, shall take care of her in every other respect and, if she desires to be married, shall see that she be given to one not unworthy; and besides what she has already received they shall give her a talent of silver out of the estate and three handmaids whomsoever she shall choose besides the maid she has at present and the man-servant Pyrrhaeus; [14] and if she chooses to remain at Chalcis, the lodge by the garden, if in Stagira, my father's house. Whichever of these two houses she chooses, the executors shall furnish with such furniture as they think proper and as Herpyllis herself may approve. Nicanor shall take charge of the boy Myrmex, that he be taken to his own friends in a manner worthy of me with the property of his which we received. Ambracis shall be given her freedom, and on my daughter's marriage shall receive 500 drachmas and the maid whom she now has. And to Thale shall be given, in addition to the maid whom she has and who was bought, a thousand drachmas and a maid. [15] And Simon, in addition to the money before paid to him towards another servant, shall either have a servant purchased for him or receive a further sum of money. And Tycho, Philo, Olympius and his child shall have their freedom when my daughter is married. None of the servants who waited upon me shall be sold but they shall continue to be employed; and when they arrive at the proper age they shall have their freedom if they deserve it. My executors shall see to it, when the images which Gryllion has been commissioned to execute are finished, that they be set up, namely that of Nicanor, that of Proxenus, which it was my intention to have executed, and that of Nicanor's mother; also they shall set up the bust which has been executed of Arimnestus, to be a memorial of him seeing that he died childless, [16] and shall dedicate my mother's statue to Demeter at Nemea or wherever they think best. And wherever they bury me, there the bones of Pythias shall be laid, in accordance with her own instructions. And to commemorate Nicanor's safe return, as I vowed on his behalf, they shall set up in Stagira stone statues of life size to Zeus and Athena the Saviours."
