Salve, munde!

Recovering from a recent illness that was not COVID-19 but still had me sufficiently incapacitated for well over a week, I solidified more and more in my mind that I dislike the 15 year experiment in social media. Some may better manage the machine, but I cannot give it purchase within my attention without it consuming. The meal where I am eaten rather than eat to borrow from Hamlet.

Working as I am to build a better template for Jekyll to serve the purposes of hosting a portfolio of texts, etc. I thought why not start this little blog. Since I have to write it all up in markdown language, if I have anything worth saying, it will have to endure the lack of instant gratification that comes from WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) platforms. For now I am running it on the local server so it will serve me as good as [the hole in the ground that Midas' barber made use of](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/hyginus/hyginus5.shtml#midas). Perhaps one day reeds might grow from that some ground and whisper, but for now I will have discretion over what is shared and with whom to some little extent.
