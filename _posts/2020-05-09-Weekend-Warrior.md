*N.B. This is from before I re-booted the theme and needs to be updated (5/19/20)*

Today's work:

1. Cleaned up the `README.md` and reconciled that with the `about.md`
2. There were some build problems with the `_config.yml` when I served the site again locally. I had to root around and eliminate a few things I forgot I had added to the file without actually following thru with all the necessaries, e.g. actually packaging the ruby gem of the theme.
3. This reminded me that I need to do better on my to-do list for the project than what I am currently doing. Probably going to start putting this up on Trello.
4. I am deciding how best to dig into the presentation of texts. As a theme, I want to have multiple ways for users to present texts baked into the theme, e.g. simple html bitext (original + translation paralleled), JSON data files called up in a viewer, etc. Considering the time sensitivity of the project, it's best to just do one and then move on to the next.
