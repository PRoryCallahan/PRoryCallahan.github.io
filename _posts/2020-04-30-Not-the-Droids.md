At first I was tinkering with adding the `_drafts` folder to this Jekyll site since 1) it's a convenient feature and 2) it's a feature I'll need to use frequently with children interrupting me when coding.

For the how-to on creating your own drafts folder, see the official Jeyll [write up](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts). But I was an idiot and forgot the initial underscore when adding the folder. I noticed the error when the draft post in the folder appeared in my nav bar when I next served the site locally. I fixed the problem, but somehow or other that reminded me to turn my attention to the 404 page: `404.html`.

Since I was confined to helping a toddler nap this afternoon, I tinkered with the text by adding a little humor to it for now. I'll probably make it more bland when Elachista is getting ready to become a shareable template.

In addition to the Star Wars image and the snippet of poetry, I emended 404 itself to reflect the Latin and Greek texts that will be served on the site and template. In http, a [404 response code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) is not four hundred four, but four-zero-four. The first digit indicates a client error and the second two digits indicate the kind of error encountered.

If 404 was four hundred four, then Roman and Greek numerals would have been easy: CDIV and ΥΔ', respectively. [Later Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Zero) developed various ways of representing zero, but I chose to go with the 8th cent.'s N for <em>nulla</em>. Greek had a [sexagesimal placeholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals#Zero) that developed over time to be something like an omicron with a macron over it, or ō.

You can see the end result [here](404.html).
