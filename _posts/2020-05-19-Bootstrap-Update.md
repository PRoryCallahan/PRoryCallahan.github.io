It's too late in the night to summarize play-by-play what was accomplished today but I was able to get through most of the backlog of what I had done in the previous version of Elachista in Classics-related upgrades. Both HTML sample texts are up. There are still bugs (probably of my own creation) with displaying STIKHOI styling of verse numbers--the line numbers are correct, I just need to get the 5s and 10s to float on the right margin.

I should be making progress by tomorrow on having the text/translation tutorial ready and I worked out more the way to present options for column displays of JSON in the future build of the Pindar Opera Viewer, the ultimate goal and engine I want to have hidden inside this little theme.
