*N.B. This is from before I re-booted the theme and needs to be updated (5/19/20)*

The title says it all. I'm working on the more advanced HTML tutorial where I've added some additional CSS and javascript to make it a little more simple and elegant, but [the bare-bones HTML tutorial is now live](/samples/html_text_1.html).

I went with *Olympian* 11 because it's in many ways the alpha and omega of my love for Greek. And I chose Sulpicia's Birthday (i.e. *Tibullus* 3.14) for the Latin because:

1. I needed elegiac distichs to demonstrates indentation with HTML.
2. She is too often overlooked.
3. I often used this poem as the intro to my intermediate Latin classes...
4. ...because it's a delightful poem.
