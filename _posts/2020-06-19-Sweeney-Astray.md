I feel like everything has turned a corner on getting the style right for the HTML, CSS, and javascript for the Pindar multitext.

Olympian 11 is live with just the Pindar ode text and dual columns based on a revised version of Drachmann's edition. I'm trying to finish reviews on the XML files for the other MSS for Olympian 11 and then I will get them loaded so I can get a better sense of all the columns in play. Here's a preview of how it stands now:

### Sweeney Astray

Trying to finish this decades long work on the Pindar scholia with 5 kids while working full-time requires the occasional break--just to walk and catch my breath. Last night, I grabbed Seamus Heaney's *Sweeney Astray* and devoured it in a single walk in the twilight after putting the kids to bed.

I'm still digesting it. It came as such a surprise and revelation. What sticks most in my mind are the descriptions of the trees.
