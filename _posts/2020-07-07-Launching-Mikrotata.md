I was spinning my wheels on _the big project_ so I took a minute this afternoon to wrap up edits on [Mikrotata](https://github.com/PRoryCallahan/Mikrotata), my Classics-oriented take on a minimal Jekyll theme.

To my knowledge there is no Jekyll theme currently deployed with this kind of Classics and other language support without a whole lot of other bells and whistles that make it unwieldy or aesthetically displeasing. Maybe that is because there is no audience for it, but having tried to transition from a traditional training in Classics to a more digital-oriented approach to Classics I think I at least would have found something like this useful.

At heart of the matter is the vast divide that stands between Digital Classics and most Classics students. There are some really incredible, amazing tools out there. Most of them still beyond my own coding skills. But the first rung on the ladder to using them is set rather high.

As departments shrink, there are fewer resources––in faculty and class time––to train students in the new tools and resources available to them. And at least in my experience, I see training confined to those departments who happen to have those faculty already trained in Digital Classics. Just as there is an initiative in the UK for "Classics for All", I would hope in the future we see a creative approach to advocate "Digital Classics for All".

Mikrotata at least is one small gesture in creating online tools for seasoned Classicists but neophyte coders who wish to become Digital Classicists.
