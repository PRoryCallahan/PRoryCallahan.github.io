Adding [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) responsiveness meant rebooting the site from scratch. But after building the samples for single column HTML texts, I realized to get the dynamic columns I desired for serving up multiple parallel texts I was going to want Bootstrap.

I wanted a clean install. After a couple days and not a few false starts I was successful. A lot of search results and Bootstrap + Jekyll templates deal with Bootstrap v.3 or earlier which made finding useful guides more difficult as I was sifting through a lot of things that should be archived.

Finally, I had success and a great deal of fun with Nick Riebeek's guide over at [Experimenting with Code](https://experimentingwithcode.com/creating-a-jekyll-blog-with-bootstrap-4-and-sass-part-1/). He is so detailed that I am just going to link you here rather than leave my own breadcrumbs for you to follow.

Why am I happy with this Bootstrap behind the scenes with Elachista?

1. Mobile first.
2. Responsive Grid System = Smart Parallel texts.
3. Better presentation of code for tutorials.
4. Actually more minimal than Minima. True story.
5. Eventually easier to customize skins for the theme.

I'll have to go back through past posts and emend or build out some of my past work. But that should be a lot easier since I documented it. And at the same time, it's on to serving up texts!
