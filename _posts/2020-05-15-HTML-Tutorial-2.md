*N.B. This is from before I re-booted the theme and needs to be updated (5/19/20)*

I cloned and then modified the [original HTML Tutorial](/samples/html_text_1.html) to incorporate Den McHenry's STIKHOI code for styling poetry. Again, I was glad to see that it had been transferred over to [CodePen](https://codepen.io/denmch/details/acEIA/) after originating over on his blog [The Campvs](http://thecampvs.com/) years ago when he was at Bryn Mawr (for it was originally called, cleverly, the Campvs Mawrtius).

Even when the Pindar Opera Viewer is installed I'm thinking STIKHOI will remain the basis of the HTML/CSS presentation of the poetry. The only difficulty is that I will have to emend it for the particulars of Pindaric meter. For now I've inserted `<br>` tags to separate strophe, antistrophe, and epode.

The current version of the HTML tutorial with STIKHOI styling can be found [here](/samples/html_text_2.html).
