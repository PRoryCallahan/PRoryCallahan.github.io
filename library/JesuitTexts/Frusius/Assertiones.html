<h3 class="mb-5">André des Freux, S.J.<br>1554</h3>
<p>This short pamphlet is one among many collections of Jesuit theological collections printed at this time. It's particular interest, though, comes from its unique author, place, and time. <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_des_Freux" target="_blank">André de Freux, S.J.</a> (1515-1556) was the first French Jesuit and a close companion of St. Ignatius. He produced the vulgate Latin translation of the <em>Spiritual Exercises</em> that are still the basis of the text we use today. Ignatius trusted him with managing the order's first intellectual initiatives in Messina (1548) and Venice (1550). Later, he served as the first rector of the Roman College (the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Gregorian_University" target="_blank">Gregorian University</a>) in 1552 where he strove to prove the order's academic rigor to existing institutions not only with debates and theological presentations (such as what follows), but also through public exhibitions of Latin poetry commenting on issues of the day and through the publication of handbooks on Latin pedagogy.</p>
