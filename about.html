                Elachista is a Jekyll-theme designed by Patrick Callahan.

              <p>
                As the name would imply (ἐλάχιστα 'the least'), the theme is intended as a Classics- and Humanities-oriented replacement for Minima, the default Jekyll theme. The theme comes with an array of tools to present texts in multiple languages, with or without parallel translations, commentary, and apparatus criticus. Installation instructions can be found here. It comes pre-loaded with the Alpheios array of tools (which can be equipped here). It provides as well a set of tutorials with multiple options for presenting texts. In addition, there is a project log here where you can see documentation on the build of the theme and explore how to make Elachista fit your own project. Feel free to check out the code in our Github repository and to make suggestions for any features you think are must-haves.
