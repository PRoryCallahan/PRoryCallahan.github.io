        <h2 id="in-the-bleak-midwinter">&ldquo;In the Bleak Midwinter&rdquo;</h2>
<h5 id="christina-rossetti">Christina Rossetti</h5>
<p>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,<br>
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;<br>
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,<br>
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.</p>
<p>Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;<br>
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.<br>
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed<br>
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,<br>
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;<br>
Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,<br>
The ox and ass and camel which adore.</p>
<p>Angels and archangels may have gathered there,<br>
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;<br>
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,<br>
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.</p>
<p>What can I give Him, poor as I am?<br>
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;<br>
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;<br>
Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-kings">&ldquo;The Three Kings&rdquo;</h2>
<h5 id="henry-wadsworth-longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h5>
<p>Three Kings came riding from far away,<br>
Melchior and Gaspar and Baltasar;<br>
Three Wise Men out of the East were they,<br>
And they travelled by night and they slept by day,<br>
For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.</p>
<p>The star was so beautiful, large and clear,<br>
That all the other stars of the sky<br>
Became a white mist in the atmosphere,<br>
And by this they knew that the coming was near<br>
Of the Prince foretold in the prophecy.</p>
<p>Three caskets they bore on their saddle-bows,<br>
Three caskets of gold with golden keys;<br>
Their robes were of crimson silk with rows<br>
Of bells and pomegranates and furbelows,<br>
Their turbans like blossoming almond-trees.</p>
<p>And so the Three Kings rode into the West,<br>
Through the dusk of the night, over hill and dell,<br>
And sometimes they nodded with beard on breast,<br>
And sometimes talked, as they paused to rest,<br>
With the people they met at some wayside well.</p>
<p>“Of the child that is born,” said Baltasar,<br>
“Good people, I pray you, tell us the news;<br>
For we in the East have seen his star,<br>
And have ridden fast, and have ridden far,<br>
To find and worship the King of the Jews.”</p>
<p>And the people answered, “You ask in vain;<br>
We know of no King but Herod the Great!”<br>
They thought the Wise Men were men insane,<br>
As they spurred their horses across the plain,<br>
Like riders in haste, who cannot wait.</p>
<p>And when they came to Jerusalem,<br>
Herod the Great, who had heard this thing,<br>
Sent for the Wise Men and questioned them;<br>
And said, “Go down unto Bethlehem,<br>
And bring me tidings of this new king.”</p>
<p>So they rode away; and the star stood still,<br>
The only one in the grey of morn;<br>
Yes, it stopped—it stood still of its own free will,<br>
Right over Bethlehem on the hill,<br>
The city of David, where Christ was born.</p>
<p>And the Three Kings rode through the gate and the guard,<br>
Through the silent street, till their horses turned<br>
And neighed as they entered the great inn-yard;<br>
But the windows were closed, and the doors were barred,<br>
And only a light in the stable burned.</p>
<p>And cradled there in the scented hay,<br>
In the air made sweet by the breath of kine,<br>
The little child in the manger lay,<br>
The child, that would be king one day<br>
Of a kingdom not human, but divine.</p>
<p>His mother Mary of Nazareth<br>
Sat watching beside his place of rest,<br>
Watching the even flow of his breath,<br>
For the joy of life and the terror of death<br>
Were mingled together in her breast.</p>
<p>They laid their offerings at his feet:<br>
The gold was their tribute to a King,<br>
The frankincense, with its odor sweet,<br>
Was for the Priest, the Paraclete,<br>
The myrrh for the body’s burying.</p>
<p>And the mother wondered and bowed her head,<br>
And sat as still as a statue of stone,<br>
Her heart was troubled yet comforted,<br>
Remembering what the Angel had said<br>
Of an endless reign and of David’s throne.</p>
<p>Then the Kings rode out of the city gate,<br>
With a clatter of hoofs in proud array;<br>
But they went not back to Herod the Great,<br>
For they knew his malice and feared his hate,<br>
And returned to their homes by another way.</p>
<h2 id="the-magi">&ldquo;The Magi&rdquo;</h2>
<h5 id="wb-yeats">W.B. Yeats</h5>
<p>Now as at all times I can see in the mind&rsquo;s eye,<br>
In their stiff, painted clothes, the pale unsatisfied ones<br>
Appear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky<br>
With all their ancient faces like rain-beaten stones,<br>
And all their helms of silver hovering side by side,<br>
And all their eyes still fixed, hoping to find once more,<br>
Being by Calvary&rsquo;s turbulence unsatisfied,<br>
The uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor.</p>
